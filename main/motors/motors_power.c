/* Motors - motors_power.c

 * Purpose: gate motor motion on the TMC2209 drivers being alive, sensed through
 * the UART probe (the drivers are fed by VM, so they are silent when the 12 V
 * rail is absent).  Both drivers must answer for the mount to move.  When power
 * is lost the motors enter ERROR and stay there until power returns, at which
 * point the TMC2209s are re-initialised (their registers were lost while
 * unpowered).
