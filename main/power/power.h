 * The ESP32-S3 board can be powered from USB alone, in which case the 12V
 * switch is off and the motors have no power — yet the firmware would still
 * run and "move" the mount.  This module senses the 5.5V output of the
 * LM2596 (fed by the 12V rail) through a 10k/10k divider on GPIO 1, so the
 * mount can refuse to move when the motors are unpowered.
