 * Event buzzer (active) — small module driven from a GPIO (HIGH = beep).

 * Produces short audible beeps for lifecycle events: power-on, and the
 * start / end of a goto or move-axis motion.
 *
 * All event decisions are made inside buzzer_update(), which polls the
 * motors status and fires the matching beep on SLEWING transitions.  No
 * other module should call buzzer_play() directly.
