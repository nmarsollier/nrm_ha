"""JSON — structural rejection of malformed request frames.

The firmware parses requests structurally (not with text search) and validates
numbers strictly.  A malformed frame — nested or duplicate keys, a negative or
fractional id/duration, trailing bytes — must be rejected with ok=false and
never execute an action.  These cases are sent as raw frames because the typed
client always builds well-formed JSON.
